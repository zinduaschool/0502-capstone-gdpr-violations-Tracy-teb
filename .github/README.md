### GDPR VIOLATIONS ( TACKLING PRIVACY IN THE NEW INFORMATION AGE) 

```
Overall objective: Use the data collected on GDPR violations to understand the landscape of
Data Protection and Privacy in Kenya. Using this information outline areas companies 
need to be on the lookout for following the institution of the Office of the Data Commissioner 
and subsequent implementation of the DPA(2019)
```

>Given the rise in use of data and the proliferation of companies such as Google whose business models are hinged on the value of user data, regulatory bodies have been forced to implement data protection and privacy regulations across the globe, for instance the GDPR, EU based. Locally in Kenya we have the Data Protection Act, which is based on the aforementioned. 
Following the implementation  of the GDPR in the EU countries a number of countries have faced fines related to different articles violated. 

**Instructions**
We have updated the project with recently available data sourced by [valentindefour](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valentindefour/gdpr-fines-referential). Feel free to use the updated data for the below listed questions/requirements/deliverables.

You can also use the previous [data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-04-21/gdpr_violations.tsv) sourced from RforDataScience TidyTuesday Project. 

You will use the data to explore/demonstrate the following, using Matplotlib and Pandas functionalities. 
1. Time breakdown of the total violations in the EU. Use this ![image](https://github.com/mcsiple/tidytuesday/blob/master/2020/GDPR.png) as a reference 
2.  Most expensive violation by country, listing the specific violation type e.g failure to comply with processing regulation. Use this ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okothchristopher/tidy_tuesday_data_exploration/master/2020_week_17_GDPR_violations/gdpr_fines.png) as reference 
3. Vodafone's GDPR violations in volume. 
4. Companies with the highest violations . Use this ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okothchristopher/tidy_tuesday_data_exploration/master/2020_week_17_GDPR_violations/gdpr_for_top_companies4.png) as a reference 
5. Map the data and make this interactive. Bonus but useful. Use this ![image](https://twitter.com/philmassicotte/status/1253460460239761411/photo/1)  and this ![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EWNsLw_XsAERssZ?format=png&name=small) as reference. 
6. Breakdown / Distribution and important metrics of fines levied per article. Prepare a Box, plot. Use this ![image](https://juliasilge.com/blog/gdpr-violations/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png) for reference. 
7. Top 10 most violated articles 
8. Articles with the highest associated fine 

Note: All your image results need not look the same as the above, but should convey the same results clearly. 

The Data Dictionary is as follows:


The data dictionary is as follows, 
|variable |class |description|
|-----|-----|-----|
|picture |character	|SVG image of violation country flag
|name |character |Name of country where violation was enforced
|price |integer |Fine price in Euros (â‚¬)
|authority |character |Authority that enacted the violation
|date |character |
|controller |character |Controller of data - the violator
|article_violated	 |character |
|source |character |Original source (URL) of fine data
